# Guessing-Game-Part-2
This is a part 2 of guessing game but in this guess game you're not guess about the number but the alphabet guess that it is must be correct


## How To Build This Game?
Simple just follow this instructions and it'll fine dude/sis. Hahahahaha :v

# Step 1: Preparing Your Codebase
Clone (copy the folder of) your guessing game project from the previous quest. This is so that you can make your customizations in this new project file.

# Step 2: Understanding the Requirements of Your Customization
For this quest, you are required to customize the code such that:

The program now randomly generates a lowercase alphabet instead of a number to guess (lowercase alphabets only).
You will now input text instead of a number.
The match function compares your input against the randomly generated alphabet.
The alphabet being randomly generated is printed in the terminal output (donâ€™t hide it).

# Step 3: Some Hints!
To successfully customize the game, you will need to change two key areas:

To generate a lowercase alphabet you will require a different external crate (dependency). Find out how to make use of the recommended external crate with these two resources:
fastrand - Rust
fastrand - crates.io
You will also need to modify your error handling code (remember .expect?) - you are now handling characters instead of numbers. See the items below to learn more about the different data types in Rust:
